# Organised Thought Obsidian Vault
## Project status: Work in Progress

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide Obsidian beginners with a template vault to help reduce the friction of implementing their workflows in Obsidian.
The vault covers the following functionality:
1) Dashboard
The purpose of the Dashboard is to show how different parts of the vault can come together to create workflows.
It provides  buttons to quickly create notes.
